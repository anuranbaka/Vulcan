 * and PathSegments are goal_route_element_t. The element is essentially a union with
 * a flag indicating which type it actually contains.
 *
 * A GoalRoute supports a confirmation flag to allow a person to be in the loop when a
 * plan is being formulated. The GoalTarget for the plan specifies if it needs to be
 * confirmed. An unconfirmed plan will not generate a DecisionTargetSequence for further
 * execution. Once confirmed, the local topo planner will begin executing the plan.
