/**
 * DecisionTask is an interface for tasks performed by the DecisionPlanner. Each task describes how the robot should
 * move through a single area. Each task can create an appropriate TaskExecutor that handles the actual motion through
 * the environment.
 *
 * Some tasks cannot be immediately accomplished in the area in which they are asked to initially execute. The most
 * common example is a "Take the next right"-style command. If the robot arrives at a decision point lacking a right
 * turn, then the correct action is to do is drive through the intersection, travel along the path segment, and turn
 * right at the following decision point (or continue this same behavior until a right turn is encountered).
 *
 * To maintain the invariant that a Task corresponds to only motion through a single area, but to allow the above
 * behavior for tasks, a Task can have prerequisite Tasks. These prerequisites should be preprended to the task
 * sequence. Once they complete, the initial Task will be re-evaluated within the new context.
 *
 * To use a Task:
 *
 *   - Check if it has prereqs, given the current state
 *       * Prepend the prereqs tasks if they exist
 *   - Else, create the executor for the task
