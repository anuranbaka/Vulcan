 * DecisionTaskExecutor is an interface for performing a DecisionTask. A TaskExecutor is able to determine when the task
 * it is executing has finished and whether or not the task can actually be completed, based on the current state.
 *
 * Each DecisionTask will create an appropriate DecisionTaskExecutor based on the state of the robot when the task
 * starts begin executed. The task executor is then provided with the DecisionState each time it changes to determine
 * the action to be taken. The action is provided as a DecisionResult.
 *
 * General use of the DecisionTaskExecutor should be along the lines of:
 *
 *   if(hasFailed())
 *       - handle failures
 *   else if(isComplete())
 *       - move to next task
