 * UnclassifiedObject is an object that has yet to be classified as one of the other DynamicObject types. Consequently,

 * The unclassified object ensures that all dynamic rays in a laser scan are represented by some sort of DynamicObject.
 *
 * An UnclassifiedObject satisifies the requirement that all dynamic laser rays be represented by some DynamicObject.
 *
 * UnclassifiedObjects never match other laser objects. They are intended to be create each iteration by a
