* addObjects will update the track for existing objects and create new tracks for newly observed objects. The ObjectId
* is used for determining which track an object should be assigned to.
*
* The catalogue allows iteration over all stored tracks, along with clearing existing tracks.
*
* The catalogue expects time to move forward in small increments. The catalogue also automatically resets if time is
* detected going backward or if time jumps forward more than a configurable number of milliseconds.
