*
*   - an id                 -> unique identifier assigned to the object to be able to keep track of it over time
*   - a pose                -> where the object is in the environment
*   - a velocity            -> in the direction of the pose
*   - a boundary shape      -> portion of space occupied by the robot
*   - a recent trajectory   -> poses where the object has been in the recent past
