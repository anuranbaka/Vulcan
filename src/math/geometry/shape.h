 * Shape is an interface defining basic attributes for a class that is meant to represent some sort
 * of geometric shape.
 *
 * Each shape has the following properties:
 *
 *   - center
 *   - area
 *   - perimeter
 *
 * The following operations are supported for a shape:
 *
 *   - contains          : check if a point is contained in the Shape
 *   - intersects        : check if a line intersects the shape
 *   - intersections     : finds all intersections between the line and the shape
 *   - distanceToPoint   : finds the distance from the boundary of the shape to a point outside the shape
