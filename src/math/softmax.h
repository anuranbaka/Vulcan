* softmax_regression performs softmax regression on a set of labeled training data. Softmax regression creates a

* 
* The input features are stored in the features matrix. This matrix is an  n+1-by-m matrix. Each column should contain
* the n measured features plus an additional value 1 for the intercept term. There is one column for each of the m
* examples for training. The labels matrix is an m-by-1 matrix where each row contains the assigned label [0,K) for 
* each column in the features matrix.
