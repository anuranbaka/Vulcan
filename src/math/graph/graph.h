* NOTE: I really really don't like how this graph is implemented at the moment, but

*       other than just points. Once the global topology begins to emerge, it will
*       become especially useful. Right now, this Graph is pretty damn useless and
*       essentially is just a wrapper around std::vector<graph_vertex_t*>. The fact that
*       the bare pointers are floating around is a BAD sign. Necessity will win
