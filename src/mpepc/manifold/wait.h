/**
* WaitTaskManifold is a simple manifold that has no progress for anything other than remaining at the robot's current
* pose. The reward is directly proportional to the amount of time the robot spends at the target pose for the duration
* of the trajectory.
* 
* The reward specifically is:
* 
*   reward = dist_from_target - timestep
* 
* Thus, if the dist from target is 0, then the maximum reward is gained. The distance from target is the sum of the
* position distance and orientation distance of the pose along the trajectory.
* 
* Each time the manifold is updated, the robot's current pose will be set as the target.
