/**
 * Declaration of the TaskManifold, which encapsulates a cost-to-go metric toward
 * achieving a task. For navigation, this is a navigation function. For person
 * pacing, this is a distance to a series of desired positions.
 *
 * Namely, a task manifold we think of is a smooth surface in the workspace of the
 * robot that has a unique minimum at the goal point. This can be understood as a
 * planar expansion of a path, which is usually a line in the workspace. This guides
 * the trajectory planner by providing the required cost-to-go metric in achieving
 * the goal. The current implementation mandates that this manifold instruction
 * updates when: (1) a new task is given; (2) the (perception of) environment has
 * changed; and/or (3) at regular time interval designated by the user.
