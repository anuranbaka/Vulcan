/**
* TrajectoryEvaluator calculates an expected cost of a trajectory. The notion of
* expected cost was first defined in "Robot Navigation with Model Predictive
* Equilibrium Point Control", by Park, Johnson and Kuipers, IROS 2012.
*
* The cost is a direct sum of expected progress, expected cost of collision and expected cost of action.
* (1) To compute expected progress, piecewise progress is calculated at each simulated step (or at some sub-sampled
*     steps for speed, as long as they are close enough so collision checking is valid.) The progress at each segment
*     is then mutiplied with the survivability, the probability that the trajectory at that step is going to be
*     collision free, to compute expected progress.
* (2) Expected cost of collision is computed similarly. The raw cost of collision is multiplied with the probability of
*     collision and we get expected cost of collision.
* (3) Expected cost of action is equal to raw cost of action, which is defined as a quadratic cost of velocities
*     along the simulated trajectory in the current implementation.
*
* For the expected progress, we can write
*
* expected_progress(X) = Sigma_(k=1)^(k=N) {survivability(x(k))*progress(k)} + angle_heuristic(x(N))
*
* where x(k) is a robot pose at time k in [0, ... ,N], along a trajectory X = {x(0) ... x(N)} to be evaluated,
* with N*timestep = T, the time horizon.
*
* We define the survivability(x(k)) as the approximated probability of the robot pose x(k) being
* collision free, and the progress(k) is the reduction in the cost-to-go toward the goal at that trajectory segment,
* e.g. NF(x(k)) - NF(x(k-1)) in the case of navigation function. angle_heuristic(x(N)) is an additional heuristic
* which promotes alignment of the final pose to the gradient of the navigation function, which of course is only valid
* if we are computing progress over the navigation function.
*
* Note that without the survivability term, which can be understood as a state-dependent, time-varying weight,
* the expected progress reduces to simple progress. which is
*
* progress(X) = NF(x(0)) - NF(x(N)) + angle_heuristic(x(N)).
*
* So the expected progress is the simple progress shown above multiplied by the time-varying probability weights at each segment.
* What does this mean? Usually, a cost function in an optimization problem is constructed as a constant-weighted sum of
* (often conflicting) sub-objectives. Then almost invariably determination of those weights becomes the real problem,
* as ill-chosen weights could lead to multiple local minima, unsmooth cost surface, etc, which results in undesirable behaviors.
* But when I have tried something like that, it was very difficult to find a set of constant weights that gave good results
* across wide range of situations.
*
* One of the key contribution of this formulation is that now we can compute those weights on-line, as a function of states
* along the simulated trajectory, in such a way that it is very easy to combine different objectives and create a nice, smooth
* cost surface that is easy to optimize over. Experimentally, the difference in robot behaviors generated from the simple progress
* with constan weights to the expected progress with probabilistic weights was very readily observable.
*
*
* UPDATE: When using the non-NF progress based on the polar coordinate, this angle_heuristic is not used anymore.
*
*
* ADDED: Now we also add negative dwell time at the goal to the progress and change the name of the variable from 'progress' to 'reward'.
* Functionally, this motivates the robot to move to the goal quickly and stay there. So what we have now, looks like:
*
* expected_reward(X) = Sigma_(k=1)^(k=N) {survivability(x(k)) * [progress(k) - dwellTime(k)] }
*
