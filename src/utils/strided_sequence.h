/**
 * strided_sequence_length calculates the number of elements in the strided sequence given some
 * initial sequence and a stride through the sequence.
 *
 * The logic is:
 *
 *   - if sequenceLength % stride == 0, stridedLength = sequenceLength / stride
 *   - else stridedLength = sequenceLength / stride + 1
 *
 * Example:
 *   Consider sequences of length 4, 5, and 6 with a stride of 3:
 *
 *   (0 1 2 3)     -> strided: (0 3)
 *   (0 1 2 3 4)   -> strided: (0 3)
 *   (0 1 2 3 4 5) -> strided: (0 3)
 *
 * \param    sequenceLength      Length of the sequence to be iterated through with a stride
 * \param    stride              Stride to use for the iteration
 * \pre  stride > 0
 * \return   Number of elements in the strided sequence.
