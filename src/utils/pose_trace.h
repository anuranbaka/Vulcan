/**
* PoseTrace represents a sequence of poses separated based on distance or time criteria. The addPose method will
* add new poses to the trace if they are far enough from the previous end pose. When the distance criterion is set,
* poses are added when:
*   
*   dist(newPose, lastPose) > distance
* 
* When the time criterion is set, poses are added when:
* 
*   newPose.timestamp - lastPose.timestamp > duration
* 
* In all cases, a maximum number of poses can be set for the trace_. When the maximum number of poses is hit, each addition
* will erase the pose at the start of the trace. Poses can also be removed via the clearAll(), clearBefore(), or clearAfter()
* methods that erase all poses occurring before or after a certain time.
*
* Poses are stored in ascending order of timestamp.
* 
* The iterators returned from begin()/end() are guaranteed to be RandomAccessIterators.
