/**
 * counting_sort is a non-comparison sort, which sorts a range of integers [0, K]. The idea
 * is to count the number of occurrences of each integer. Then a cumulative total of the
 * occurrences can be created. The data is looked at again and the index in the count array
 * tells exactly where the next element should go.
 *
 * Right now, each element being sorted is assumed to have a .value parameter. This condition
 * is extremely limiting for certain. Needs to be fixed by allowing a functor to be provided
 * for accessing the numeric value associated with the particular values being sorted
 *
 * See CLRS Section 8.2 for details and a proof of correctness.
 *
 * \param    K               Template parameter specifying the maximum value to be considered
 * \param    begin           Starting iterator for the data
 * \param    end             End iterator for the data
 * \param    outputBegin     Starting iterator for the output
 * \pre      outputBegin is the start iterator for a data structure that can hold at least end-begin values.
 * \pre      begin, end, and outputBegin are bi-directional, random-access iterators.
