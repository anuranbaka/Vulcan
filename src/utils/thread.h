/**
* Thread is a wrapper around the pthreads library. It provides the major functionality
* needed to run a member function in a separate thread.
*
* Threads come in two varieties: detached and joinable. A detached thread is spawned
* and never returns again. The only communication between the parent thread and
* the new thread is through shared variables. A joinable thread, on the other hand,
* can be joined, which means that the parent thread can wait until the joinable thread
* finished execution before continuing on with further processing.
*
* Threads can also be marked to be persistant. A persistant thread does not die after
* the function that it was executing returns. Instead, once this happens the Thread
* goes into a suspended state, where it will remain until a new task is attached to it.
* Or until it is told to die. This is handy for use in thread pools or in parallel
* algorithms where having threads around to do some processing is handy.
*
* A class can be run within a thread by inheriting Threadable and overriding the
* run method. After this, an instance of the class can be passed to attachTask(),
* which will run the class once the thread is started.
