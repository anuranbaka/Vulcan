/**
 * LockedDoubleBuffer is a thread-safe double buffer for storing incoming data in one buffer
 * while reading data from the other buffer. The general usage pattern is this:
 *
 *   1) Wait until hasData is true, then swap the buffers.
 *   2) Read data from one thread
 *   3) Write data from a different thread
 *   4) Go back to 1.
 *
 * The locking mechanism, as currently implemented, expects read() and swapBuffers() calls to be
 * synchronous and occurring from the same thread. This assumption allows reading and writing to
 * occur safely on separate threads without blocking each other.
