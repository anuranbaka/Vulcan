/**
* Image is an abstract data type that encapsulates information pertaining to an
* image frame pulled from the camera. An Image contains the dimensions of the image
* as well as a buffer of all the pixels, using one of the colorspaces defined in the Colorspace enum.
*
* All pixels, regardless of colorspace, are represented as 3 unsigned bytes. One byte for each component
* of the color, e.g. R, G, B or Y,U,V. If the colorspace is not typically defined on this scale, the
* value will be normalized to fit within this scale. For example, HSV is defined with H as 0-360, and
* S and V 0-1. But each will be between 0-255 using the Image class.
*
* Conversion between the various colorspaces is provided via functions defined in color_conversions.h.
