/**
 * Graph is a standard undirected graph data structure consisting of vertices and edges. Graphs are built
 * vertex-by-vertex and edge-by-edge via addVertex() and addEdge() methods. The vertices and edges
 * are copied to internal structures, so lightweight classes for these types make the most sense.
 *
 * Graph is templated by a Vertex class and an Edge class. Vertex classes must implement the following policy
 * (there may be additional requirements by algorithms that use the Graph):
 *
 *   - operator==           : need to be able to check equality of nodes
 *   - operator<            : need to be able to sort vertices/put them in an associative container
 *
 * Vertex defined in graph/vertex.h is a simple implementation of this policy.
 *
 * Edge classes must implement the following policy (there may be additional requirements by algorithms
 * that use the Graph):
 *
 *   - getStart()            : retrieve the Vertex at one end of the Edge
 *   - getEnd()              : retrieve the Vertex at the other end of the Edge
 *   - operator==            : check equality between two edges
 *
 * The type returned by getStart() and getEnd() must be the same type as the Vertex class.
 *
 * Edge defined in graph/edge.h is a simple implementation of this policy.
 *
 * The addVertex() and addEdge() methods are virtual to allow the construction of specialized graphs,
 * like edge-ordered or directed graphs, via subclassing the Graph class.
