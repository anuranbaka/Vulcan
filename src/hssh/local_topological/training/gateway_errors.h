* GatewayErrors maintains error information for all generated gateways relative to a set of ground-truth gateways.
* Gateway errors are computed as follows:
*   
*   - for each generated gateway:
*       - find the nearest ground-truth gateway along its voronoi edge
*       - if no gateway exists on the edge, it is added to unmatched false positives and distance is the edge length
*       - if it matches, then the distance is the distance along the edge in cells
*       - associate the gen gateway with g.t. gateway
* 
*   - after association, compute TP, FP, FN for each g.t. gateway:
*       - if num assoc == 0, then FN
*       - if num assoc > 0, then TP
*       - if num assoc > 1, then FP += num assoc - 1
