/**
* \file     area_labels.h
* \author   Collin Johnson
*
* Declaration of functions for saving and loading ground-truth labeled areas and features:
*
*   - save_map_labels
*   - load_map_labels
*
* Saving and loading the labeled areas should use the following steps:
*
* Saving:
*
*   When saving a map (when the Store Labels or Save Labels button is pressed),
*
*       1) Call save_map_labels
*       2) Use the returned LabeledAreaData for classification
*
* Loading:
*
*   When loading a map,
*
*       1) Call load_map_labels
*       2) Use the returned LabeledAreaData for classification
*
*
* Each map has its data stored in multiple files all associated with the map's filename. The naming scheme for maps
* must follow this format:
*
*   'building'('floor')(_'incremental number')
*
*   - The building name must not contain numbers.
*   - The floor must be a number.
*   - The incremental number must be separated by an underscore and be a number.
*
* For example, the third floor of the EECS building is eecs3. The thirtieth map in an incremental sequence of
* maps of the third floor of the EECS building is eecs3_30.
*
* The load_labels_file takes a file with a .lbl extension, which has the following format:
*
*       map_name1 map_directory1
*       map_name2 map_directory2
*               .
*               .
*               .
*       map_nameN map_directoryN
*
* The map_name is assumed to end in .lpm and thus the file extension should be left off. For simplicity, don't put any
* underscores in the 'building' name.
*
* The map_directory should be the absolute directory of the map file.
*
