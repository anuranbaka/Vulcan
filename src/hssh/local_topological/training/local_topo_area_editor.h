/**
* LocalTopoAreaEditor is an editor that allows hand-labeling and merging of area hypotheses in an LPM.
* The editor is able to build the local topological representation up to the point where AreaHypotheses are created.
*
* The basic flow for using LocalTopoAreaEditor is:
*
*   - buildSkeleton : create the VoronoiSkeletonGrid underlying all local topo representations
*   - findGateways : find gateways in the current grid
*   - constructHypotheses : create the area hypotheses based on a set of gateways
*
* At this point, the AreaHypotheses found can be iterated over. Two operations can be performed on the hypotheses:
*
*   - label : assign a label to an area
*   - merge : merge a set of hypotheses into a single hypothesis
*
* An integer is used as the handle for changing the area hypotheses. Whenever a new LPM is processed, the handles,
* along with the hypothesis iterators are invalidated.
