/**
* PathDirectionDector monitors the progress of the robot as it moves along a path. The purpose is to
* detect if the robot has turned around mid-path, before reaching the next area. To detect
* turning around mid-path, the motion of the robot relative to the entry gateway is monitored. 
* If the robot begins moving toward the entry gateway, then after a short time, a 
* TurnedAroundEvent will be generated indicating the robot is moving toward the entry
* gateway rather than the opposite end of the path.
*
* The formal calculation proceeds as follows:
*
*   1) A new path is set for the detector. The center of the entry gateway is stored.
*   2) As the robot moves along the path, the angle between the vectors going from gateway center to robot center
*      and robot center to one meter along the robot's orientation are calculated.
*   3) If the angle between these vectors is >pi/2, the robot is moving to the next place.
*   4) If the angle is below pi/2, mark the last location where it was above as p.
*   5) Calculate r_entry,p and r_entry,cur. If r_entry,p - r_entry,cur > r_thresh, generate a turned around event.
