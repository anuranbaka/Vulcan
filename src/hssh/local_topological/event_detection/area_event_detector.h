 *
 * The interface for an AreaEventDetector consists of two parts:
 *
 *   1) Checking if any events have occurred (hasEventOccurred)
 *   2) Adding those events to a collection of events (addEvents)
 *
 * These methods should be used in conjunction with one another. The events are determined by comparing the state of
 * the robot and environment in the previous call to hasEventOccurred with the current state. As a result, if events
 * have occurred, addEvents must be called before another call to hasEventOccurred, otherwise the events will be wiped
 * out.
