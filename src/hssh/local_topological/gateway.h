/**
* Gateway defines the location and properties of a gateway in the world. A gateway is the boundary between two areas in metric space, usually a
* path and a place. The gateway forms a bridge between the metric and topological descriptions of space, as topological places are based on symbols
* derived from gateways in the place.
*
* Being that the gateway abstraction separates two areas in small-scale space, the gateway representation fundamentally consists of a boundary, a
* direction, and two normals emanating from the center of the gateway. In addition to the metric coordinates of the boundary and center, the
* gateway contains the cells it occupies in the map it was built from. The cell representation is useful when comparing a gateway to the Voronoi
* skeleton, which is a cell-based representation.
*
* The boundary for a gateway is such that the .a of the boundary line is sorted topographically, so boundary.a < boundary.b
*
* Gateways are immutable.
*
* The gateway description contains the following:
*
*   - id            : id of the gateway in the place description
*   - center        : location of the gateway in the LPM
*   - boundary      : line segment defining the gateway in the LPM
*   - direction     : direction of the interior of the place from the center of the gateway -- the normal of the gateway pointing into the place
*   - cellBoundary  : cells the gateway boundary occupies
*   - skeletonCell  : cell in the Voronoi skeleton through which the gateway passes
