 * SkeletonGraphExtractor parses through the VoronoiSkeletonGrid and converts the discretized cells
 * into a true graph data structure to which graph algorithms can be applied.
 *
 * SkeletonGraphExtractor is meant to be used only in conjunction with the SkeletonPruner.
 * The two classes are very much entwined. The SkeletonGraph structure isn't safe to use
 * outside of the limited context due to the memory sharing that occurs within it. Rest
 * of the system is abstracted behind the SkeletonPruner though, so all should be fine.
 *
 * If it comes to pass that the SkeletonGraph does need to exist outside the Pruner,
 * then a deep copy of the graph will have to be made so that memory problems don't
 * force the explosion of anything that attempts to touch it.
