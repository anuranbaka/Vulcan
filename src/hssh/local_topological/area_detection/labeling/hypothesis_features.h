 * HypothesisFeatures calculates a number of features pertaining to an AreaHypothesis.

 *
 *   Voronoi-based features:
 *       - widthVariation  :    coefficient of variation of cell widths  -- std width / mean width
 *       - axisRatio       :    max / (maj + min)
 *
 *   Ray-based isovist features:
 *       - rayCompactnessMean :  avg ray dist / max ray dist
 *
 *   Polygon-based isovist features:
 *       - circularityMean      :    0 = line, 1 = circle, paths are lower, square-ish rooms are higher -- isoperimetric
 * quotient
 *       - shapeCompactnessMean :
 *       - eccentricityMean     :
 *
 *   Visibility-based features:
 *       - avgPathEdgeCount :  average number of edges in a path between any two nodes in the hypothesis
 *
 * Exploration is stored separated from the shape-based features because it isn't the same type of thing and
 * provides more of a h*igh-level info on how much of the area has been seen, which shouldn't be involved in
 * the final classifier
