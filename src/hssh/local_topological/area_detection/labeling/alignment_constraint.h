/**
* AlignmentConstraint enforces constraints between pairs of gateways that boundary an area. Gateways can have two
* possible alignments:
*
*   - aligned : the gateways belong to the same path in the small-scale star
*   - unaligned : the gateways belong to different paths in the small-scale star
*
* A constraint consists of two outside and one inside area. The outside areas are those bounded by only one of the two
* gateways, while the inside is bounded by both gateways.
*
* The valid states for areas are defined below, split between the outside and inside areas. The ordering of the outside
* areas doesn't matter.
*
*              Outside:    Inside:          Notes:
*   Aligned:
*
*               path,path   path,dp         Destination can't have a path running through it
*               path,dst    any
*               path,dp     path,dp         Destination can't close loops between path and decision
*               dp,dp       path,dp         Destination can't close loops between path and decision
*               dp,dst      any
*               dst,dst     any
*
*   Unaligned:
*
*               path,path   dp              Unaligned paths are the definition of a decision point
*               path,dst    any
*               path,dp     dp              A path unaligned with a decision is still a decision
*               dp,dp       dp              Unaligned decisions must have a decision between them
*               dp,dst      any
*               dst,dst     any
*
*   Aligned:
*               path,path   dp              Aligned paths can only have a decision point between them
*               path,dst    dp,dst          Aligned path and dest only occurs at a place
*               path,dp     none            If a path and decision are aligned, nothing can go between
*               dp,dp       path            Aligned decision points can only have a path between them
*               dp,dst      path,dst        Aligned decision and dest can have a dest or path between
*               dst,dst     dp,path         Aligned dests can have paths or decision
*
*   End:        dp          dest,path       End area can only be a dest or path
*               dest        dest            The outside for a path can only connect to decision
*               path        dest            Any other connection must be a destination
*
*   Fixed:      The area must be assigned a single fixed type.
*
*   Exit:       Neighboring mutable areas cannot be the same type, which avoid the exit transition being merged away.
