/**
 * TopologicalMapEditor provides a means of incrementally constructing a topological
 * map independent of the other layers of the HSSH. The editor is intended to be used
 * for building maps from a set of local places in the real world to create more complex
 * synthetic environments for testing large-scale mapping without having to create an
 * hours-long dataset.
 *
 * Constructing a topological map consists of performing the following operations in
 * some order:
 *
 *   0) Either create a new map or load a previously saved map.
 *   1) Add new places to the map.
 *   2) Connect places in the map.
 *   3) Save the map to disk for later use.
 *
 * New places are not immediately added to the topological map being built because they
 * first need to be connected to an existing place in the map.
 *
 * The map editor supports undoing or redoing some number of map building steps as specified
 * in the constructor.
 *
 * Editing functionality is currently limited to adding new places to the map or connecting
 * places within the map. Places cannot be unconnected once in the map. Places that have been
 * added but not connected can, however, be deleted. Perhaps in the future, full editing
 * of an existing map will be supported.
