 * EventLogRunner loads poses and events from stored logs. The logs can be either an AreaStabilityLog that contains
 * LocalAreaEvents and LocalPoses, or they can be two text files, one containing the events and the other the LocalPose.
 *
 * To create the AreaStabilityLog, use the generate_stability_logs.sh script, which will perform the correct local and
 * global localization, along with the detection of area transitions.
 *
 * The event runner replaces using a system::Module. The runner will feed data to the GlobalTopoDirector via its
 * handleData methods using data read from the log files. The run method will keep going until it has passed all data
 * to the director, at which point it returns and the final topological map will be constructed -- or subsequent events
 * can be fed in.
 *
 * The event runner supports an interactive mode, where the user must hit enter to trigger the next local topo event
 * to fire.
