 *   - are_compatible_places : check if the entry + place combinations are compatible with a loop closure

/**
 * is_possible_loop_closure checks if it is even possible that a loop closure exists for the frontier transition and
 * the newly entered area. This function is intended as an initial filter before doing the more complicated checks
 * for compatible path segments as described below.
 *
 * A possible loop closure requires:
 *
 *   - The new area to be the same type as the existing area
 *   - The area on the other side of the frontier transition to be unknown or of the same type as the previous area
 *
 * This function performs the initial type checks. After these checks, you should use the specific functions that check
 * the symbolic match between two areas of the same type.
 *
 * \param    newLocation             New location of the robot to see if it might be the existing area
 * \param    frontierTransition      Frontier transition in the existing area
 * \param    existingArea            Existing area against which to check for a valid loop closure
 * \return   True if a loop closure might exist.
