/**
 * GeneratorQueue is an abstract base class for the queue of map hypotheses maintained for TopologicalSLAM. The queue
 * determines the order and stopping condition for a SLAM update performed when a new topological event occurs.
 *
 * The queue works by selecting the next generator to use to create a map hypothesis. This generator creates a new map
 * hypothesis, which is then returned. After construction, the computed posterior probability of the hypothesis is set
 * in the queue to help determine when the current update can stop. If there are no hypotheses in the queue, then the
 * update is done.
 *
 * The basic use of GeneratorQueue goes as follows:
 *
 *   - Add generators for all leaf hypotheses
 *   - Set the depth of a complete map.
 *   - while hasNext is true, keep generating maps
 *   - for each map, add its posterior probability to help check the stopping condition
 *   - additionally, probability heuristics that are used for ordering hypotheses must be provided
 *
 * For a subclass, they need to implement the methods:
 *
 *   - doUpdateCompletePosterior : incorporate a new complete posterior into the check for an update being complete
 *   - doUpdateCompleteDepth : set the new depth for complete hypotheses, which is used to trigger a new update starting
 *   - shouldGenerateMap : check if a new map needs to be generated, given the current state of the queue
