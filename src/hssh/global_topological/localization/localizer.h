/**
 * TopologicalLocalizer is an base class for implementations of topological localization. The localizer takes
 * one TopologicalState along with the current visit and then determines a distribution across possible future
 * topological states.
 *
 * The localizer provides three points of customization:
 *
 *   - handleEnteredEvent : decide what to do when the area is entered
 *   - handleExitedEvent : decide what to do when the area is exited
 *   - handleTurnAroundEvents : decide what to do when the robot turns around on a path
 *
 * The default behavior for these methods assumes deterministic actions by the robot. The result of actions are:
 *
 *   - turning around : the robot deterministically reverses its direction along the path. The new location distribution
 *       contains only the current path with the direction reversed.
 *   - exiting an area : the robot deterministically exits an area. The exit transition leads to the associated area as
 *       determined by the GlobalTransitionCycle or Sequence.
 *   - entering an area : the robot has entered the area that was predicted by the previous exited event. The location
 * is the same as what the exited event specified.
