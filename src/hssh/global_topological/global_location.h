* GlobalLocation contains the recent state of the robot moving within the topological map. The robot state
* has two components, a path state and a place state. These states are maintained for the most recent
* motion along a path or within a place. Thus, when in a place, the path state won't change until the
* place is exited and the robot is once again moving along a path. Similarly, the state maintained for
* motion in a place doesn't reset until a new place is entered.
