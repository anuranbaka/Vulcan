/**
 * TreeOfMaps maintains the current set of valid hypotheses for the topological map of
 * the environment. The valid hypotheses are each described by a TopologicalMapHypothesis.
 *
 * The hypotheses within the TreeOfMaps can be accessed in two ways: through the leaves or by
 * depth in the tree. The tree maintains the current set of leaves across all depths of the tree.
 * Each hypotheses for each depth of the tree are also maintained.
 *
 * The tree can be modified in the following ways:
 *
 *   - createInitialHypothesis : create the root hypothesis for the tree.
 *   - addNewPlace             : add a new place to the given map, generating a new child hypothesis
 *   - connectPlaces           : assert two places in a map to be equal, creating a new child hypothesis
 *                               with the given loop closure hypothesis.
 *   - copyMapToNextDepth      : if navigating in a known part of the map, no places are added or loop
 *                               closures created, but new measurements are made. Thus, the map needs to
 *                               be updated to the next depth of the tree to indicate which actions and
 *                               measurements it is current with.
 *   - prune                   : remove an inconsistent hypothesis from the tree. Pruning will continue
 *                               recursively until a parent hypothesis with more than the single pruned
 *                               child exists.
