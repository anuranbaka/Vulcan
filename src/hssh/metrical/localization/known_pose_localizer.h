/**
 * KnownPoseLocalizer is the simplest possible localizer. It requires odometry data and if odometry is available, it
 * simply assumes that the odometry is correct. Thus, it builds maps using dead reckoning, or if the poses come from
 * some oracle, a correct map that by-passes the normal particle filter calculations.
 *
 * The returned pose will always be relative to the pose provided in resetPoseEstimate. Thus, the reset pose puts the
 * robot in the map at (0, 0, 0).
