/**
* MetricRelocalizer relocalizes the robot within a stored metric gridmap using current sensor data.
* The relocalizer runs the same particle filter as the local_metric_hssh localizer. The relocalizer
* is provided a relocalization request that contains the stored map and the estimated region in which
* the robot might be located.
* 
* The initial estimate for the region can be one of the following, as specified via relocalization_initialization_mode_t:
* 
*   - A Gaussian distribution from which the actual pose can be sampled.
*   - A rectangular region from which the samples should be drawn uniformly.
*   - Use a scan matcher to determine the initial Gaussian from which to sample.
* 
* After initialization, the relocalizer is run using the same sensor inputs as the normal local SLAM process. After
* each update, the progress of the relocalization is given. Once completed, then the relocalization action should
* be performed via the performAction() method, followed by sending out the message indicating the success or
* failure of the relocalization.
* 
* On each update, debugging info for the relocalization can be obtained. The information includes the initial samples,
* the current samples, the estimated pose, and the map. Combining these will allow for seeing how progress is moving
* along with regards to figuring out the robot position in the map.
