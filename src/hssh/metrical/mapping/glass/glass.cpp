/*
Notes on this file/module
This program uses a blackboard model for all of its work.

Inputs (in glass_input.h):
laser.range		//the range to the target in meters
     .inten		//intensity of the return, >100 is reasonable intensity, >1000 is high confidence, >4000 is brighter
than brightest white .ang       //the angle of the ray in world coordinates .lo		//lowest scan angle in the scan .hi
//highest scan angle in the scan .uncert    //the uncertainty of the ray (not used right now, in theory should be) .x
//x in grid coords of ray tip (0,0 is upper left corner of upper left pixel) .y         //y in grid coords

bot.x        //x in grid coords
   .y        //y in grid coords
   .dir      //the direction of motion of the robot as an angle in world coords

gridsize				 //the size of the grid in pixels

State (in glass_state.h):
    Images:
        belief      //the amount that we believe that a cell is occupied right now
        flips       //the number of times a cell has changed from believed occupied to believed unoccupied(will be
usefull for static occupancy calculation) seen        //the number of times we have seen a cell miss        //the number
of times we have failed to see a cell from a known visible angle transp      //the number of times a cell has been
transparent(we saw something farther away) phivis.lo   //the widest angular range we have seen the cell from .hi .valid
        phiseen.lo  //the recent angles where we have seen the cell
               .hi
               .valid
        phimiss.lo  //the range of angles from which we have not recently seen this cell and could(should?) have seen it
               .hi
               .valid
    Sets:
        active      //the cells that are actively needing processing this time around, kept updated to corespond to
cells where belief >0 Size: size		//the current size of the grid Temporary Images: label;       //the internal
labels(transparent, unknown, unscannable, etc.) for all cells on the current scan.

Dependencies:
    Utility:
        angdiff(a,b)        //returns mod((a-b+pi),2pi)-pi , the smallest signed angular difference between a and b
        angTo(cell)			//returns the angle to a cell, given by its linear index, from the bot
        C(a)                //returns the natural form of the angle, mod(a,2pi)
        mod(a,b)            //returns modulus, floor style(result same sign as divisor)

    Internal:
        knownVisible(cell)   //returns whether a cell is at known visible angle
        shouldSee(cell)      //returns whether a cell is unoccluded, scannable, knownvisible to better than can be
explained by uncert isOverlapping        //used by shouldSee to figure out overlapping
        trackadd(ang,&lo,&hi,&valid,dir)//tries to expand the track defined by lo,hi,valid to include ang in the
direction dir(+1=ccw,-1=cw) getTransparent       //returns the cells that are transparent(ie. closer than the laser
observation in that direction).
                             //  These are the cells that are normally decremened in a occ grid.
        calculateTransparent //Figures out what cells are seen
        preprocessLaserScan  //cleans up the laser scan before use by removing points out of bounds, with negative
range, too low intensity, etc.





The basic principles of the algorithm's behavior are:
    1. points are unknown until evidence otherwise
    2. any point seen right now is more likely than not to be occupied now (i.e.belief>0)
    3. if a cell has previously been occupied and is now not occupied, it requires multiple observations to be
considered staticly occupied (this will probably not be explictly stated)
    4. not seeing a cell that has never been seen is evidence that the cell is free
    5. not seeing a cell that has been seen is only evidence for freeness if it is at an angle where we should see it
