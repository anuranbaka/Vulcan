/**
* Quantum6000 is the driver for controlling the Quantum6000 wheelchair. The Quantum6000 has two
* components, a controller and a joystick. These components are connected via a CAN-Bus. Many messages
* are relayed between the two devices, most of them are unimportant for the actual driving of the
* wheelchair and are heartbeats, and that sort of thing.
*
* This Quantum6000 driver works by intercepting the messages sent from the controller and from the
* joystick. Most of the messages are just relayed through the program. The joystick position command,
* though, is replaced by a robot-derived command. Thus, the Quantum6000 is driven by pretending to
* be the joystick.
*
* The Quantum6000 uses two USB-to-CAN adapters to read the controller and joystick messages. The
* ports of these adapters are provided in the constructor. The driver determines which bus is which
* and will begin commanding the wheelchair once it is attached to a thread and executed.
