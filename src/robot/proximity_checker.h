/**
 * ProximityChecker looks to see if any obstacles are within some safety rectangle defined around the robot.
 *
 * The ProximityChecker uses the following approach for determining how much to adjust the motion command:
 *
 *   0) Select all points within the warning boundary rectangle surrounding the robot.
 *   1) Calculate the robot pose transform given the motion command.
 *   2) Transform all points of interest by the calculated pose transform.
 *   3) Select only those points that get closer to the robot after being transformed.
 *   4) For each selected point, calculate a scaling factor based on the distance of the transformed
 *      point to the robot: minFactor + (maxFactor-minFactor)*(maxDist-dist)/maxDist.
 *   5) Select the highest slowdown factor and scale the motion command by that amount.
