/**
 * HokuyoURGLaser is a driver for communicating with the series of Hokuyo laser rangefinders
 * that use the URG library and SCIP protocol for communications. The two lasers used in the
 * IRL lab, and consequently on Vulcan itself, are the UTM-30LX and the URG-04LX.
 *
 * The lasers communicate via a USB-to-Serial port that needs to be provided in the constructor.
 * There are currently no settings that need to be modified. The class is instantiated and started
 * and then beautiful laser data can begin being extracted via the getLaserScan() method.
 *
 * At the moment, HokuyoURGLaser does not run on its own thread. As such, a program using this class
 * will need to process the data fast enough to keep pace with the data being sent by the sensor.
 * The fastest laser that will be controlled by this class runs at 40Hz.
