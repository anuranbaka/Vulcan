/**
 * image_object_t represents an object extracted from the current image. An object
 * contains a feature descriptor consisting of a color histogram and spin image.
 * This combination of features provides color and texture information about the
 * surface from which the object was extracted.
 *
 * An image object contains the following information:
 *
 *   - center            : center pixel of the object
 *   - average color     : average color of the interior pixels
 *   - boundary pixels   : indices of the pixels on the boundary of the object
 *   - histogram         : color histogram of pixels in the object
 *   - spin image        : spin image of the intensities around the center of the object
 *   - ground flag       : 0 = unknown, -1 = not ground, 1 = ground
 *   - has agent flag    : 1 = agent on segment, 0 = no agent, -1 = segment *is* agent
 *
 * NOTE: Histograms and spin images are only calculated for segments for whom hasAgent=1
