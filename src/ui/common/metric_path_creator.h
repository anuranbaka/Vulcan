 * MetricPathCreator is responsible for making new controller_waypoint_path_t based on the where the user clicks
 * on the displayed map. The paths are made by combining the mouse position at two events. When the mouse
 * button is pressed, that establishes the location of waypoint. The angle between the mouse position when
 * the button is released establishes the desired orientation. Simple and cool.
 *
 * The path creator can have a bounded path length if desired. If creating a single waypoint target, a max
 * length of 1 can be specified. If the max length of a path has been reached, any subsequent waypoints will
 * replace the last waypoint in the path.
